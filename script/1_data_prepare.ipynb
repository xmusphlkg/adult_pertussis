    "# Merge ZIP CSV Files into SQLite Database and Split by `measure_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "This script processes multiple ZIP files, each containing a CSV file with the same name as the ZIP file.\n",
    "It extracts the CSV files, merges their data into a single DataFrame, and writes the combined data into an SQLite database.\n",
    "The data is split into multiple tables based on the unique values in the `measure_name` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "- Python 3.10.8\n",
    "- Libraries: os, zipfile, pandas, sqlite3, multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "1. Place this notebook in the same directory as the `data/download` folder containing the ZIP files.\n",
    "2. Run all cells in the notebook.\n",
    "3. A SQLite database named `merged_data.db` will be created in the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "- A SQLite database file (`merged_data.db`) containing multiple tables, one for each unique value in the `measure_name` column.\n",
    "- Each table is named after the corresponding `measure_name` value."
